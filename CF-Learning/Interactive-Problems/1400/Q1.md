## Prime and Composite

- Every composite number has a prime factor less than or equal to its square root.
- If a number has no prime factors less than or equal to its square root, then it is prime.
- **Every Composite number can be represented as a product of prime numbers.**

### Example:

- `12 = 2 * 2 * 3`
- `15 = 3 * 5`
- `34 = 2 * 17`

## Prime Factorization

- The prime factorization of a number is the representation of the number as a product of prime numbers.
- The prime factorization of a number can be found by dividing the number by its smallest prime factor and repeating the process with the quotient until the quotient becomes 1.
  **Example:**
- The prime factorization of 12 is `2 * 2 * 3`.
- The prime factorization of 15 is `3 * 5`.
